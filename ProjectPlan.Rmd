# Main ideas :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## App wise :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Add tabs for, "Diagnosis history", "Lab analysis history", "Medications", "Health Profile", in the main menu.
2) "Medications" should have "Current", "Chronic", and "Previous" tabs
3) Add another tab for partner "Hospitals", "Clinics", "Labs", and "Pharmacies"

## Database wise :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Create an encrypted database for each medical history tab and user credentials, and manage proper access privileges.
2) Set up a dedicated server for the database.
3) Figure out how to create account types (Hospital/clinic, lab, pharmacy, patient).

# Other Considerations :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) Medical booking service.
2) Map showing the locations and numbers of partners. (similar to medright)
3) Discounts for app users
