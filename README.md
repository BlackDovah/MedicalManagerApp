# Main goal :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Create an app that acts as medical hub for patients and medical providers,
containing a patient's full medical profile, including full medical history,
medical conditions, inherited traits, previous diagnosis, lab analysis results,
chronic, previous and current medications, to facilitate healthcare streamline and facilitate healthcare services.

The database is currently not hosted on any cloude service, and is only there to allow the app to run, so created accounts will not be saved between instances.
